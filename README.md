# SCNX Community

Hey and welcome to our SCNX Community repository!

I'm currently beginning to develop the website for SCNX Community - since I'm new to coding, it will take a while until everything looks good, but I think in the end of 2026 it should be ready!
I will try to push new changes every day, but this can variates due my motivation and free time (:

You can find the current status on our GitHub Pages website: https://horizons-developments.github.io/scnx-community

**Important:**

I have decided to work with absolute paths to work on our public website later, so the navigation on the GitHub Pages website will not work longer anymore.
Thanks for your understanding and see you on the public website soon!

If you have any questions, problems, suggestions or something else, feel free to open a new issue so I can get back to you as soon as possible.

Have a nice day and enjoy developing!

Timon
