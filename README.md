# SCNX Community

Hey and welcome to our SCNX Community repository!

I'm currently beginning to develop the website for SCNX Community - since I'm new to coding, it will take a while until everything looks good, but I think in the end of 2026 it should be ready!
I will try to push new changes every day, but this can variates due my motivation and free time (:

You can find the current status on our website: https://fellwedel.de
I know what you think about that - "What an amazing domain" :P
But my family owns this domain for a while and it was unused until now, so why don't start on this damin? :P

**Note:**

I have decided to work with absolute paths to work on our public website later, so the GitHub Pages websites will not displayed correctly anymore.
Thanks for your understanding and see you on the public website soon!
If you nevertheless want to see our GitHub Pages website, you can find it here: https://horizons-developments.github.io/scnx-community

If you have any questions, problems, suggestions or something else, feel free to open a new issue so I can get back to you as soon as possible!

Have a nice day and enjoy developing!

Timon
