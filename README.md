# SCNX Community

Hey and welcome to our SCNX Community repository!

I'm currently beginning to develop the website for SCNX Community - since I'm new to coding, it will take a while until everything looks good, but I think in a few months it should be ready!
I often develop locally, so I don't will push changes so much here, but an extra reason for you to being excited about the new update!

You can find the current status on our GitHub Pages website: https://horizons-developments.github.io/scnx-community

If you have any questions, problems, suggestions or something else, feel free to open a new issue so I can get back to you as soon as possible.

Have a nice day and enjoy developing!

Timon
