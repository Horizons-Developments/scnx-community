# SCNX Community

Hey and welcome to our SCNX Community repository!

## General information

I'm currently beginning to develop the website for SCNX Community - since I'm new to coding, it will take a while until everything looks good, but I think in 2026 it should be ready!
I will try to push new changes every day, but this can variates due my motivation and free time (:

## Current status

You can either find the current status on our public website (recommend) or on our GitHub Pages website (may not work due absolute paths).

- Public: https://fellwedel.de
- GitHub Pages: https://horizons-developments.github.io/scnx-community

We know, the name of the public domain is a little bit weird, but we owned this domain already and it was unused, so we have decided to start on this great domain :P

No worries, we will change it to the official domain when we finished the website (:
